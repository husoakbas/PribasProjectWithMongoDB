Requirement:

A tool to track important moments with exact date time information and attached documents to answer one question: What happened?
All events, moments etc. can be created in a timeline and can be tagged.

Later it can be extended to a social platform where people share moments to answer “What happened?” with evidence documents.

Model:

user:{
	userid: ObjectId
	username: String,
        email: String,
        password: String,
            ...
} 

timeline:{
	title: String,
        description: String
        moments: [  MomentObj ],
        userid: ref,
        creation_date: datetime,
        tags: [ String ] 
}

moment:{
	title: String,
        description: String,
        moment_date: datetime,
        attachments: [ File ],
        creation_date: datetime
} 

 
TODO: 

1. API Design (REST)
2. Implementation, Documentation
3. Share code on github
3. If possible dockerize your service for deployment
4. A small document (README) where you decscribe your solution shortly

API should allow f
1. Timeline Creation / Update / Delete
2. Moments Creation / Update / Delete
3. Timeline Listing
4. Timeline Presentation (Moment Listing)
5. Search in Moments / Timeline


Notes: 
We expect you to use Java, Spring ecosystem tools for implementation.
For data persistency MongoDB is preferred but you are free to choose any other.
You do not need to implement all features but please complete as much as you can.
